The origin can be traced to the phrase in past tense 
(“Houston, we've had a problem here”) that was used 
by the crew of the Apollo 13 moon flight, to report 
a major technical problem back to their Houston base. 
The phrase is normally misquoted as “Houston, we 
have a problem” as in the movie Apollo 13: 
“Houston, we have a problem”. See Houston, We've 
Had a Problem (NASA).
