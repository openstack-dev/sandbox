The origin can be traced to the phrase in past tense
(“Houston, we've had a problem here") that was used
by the crew of the Apollo 13 moon flight, to report
a major technical problem back to their Houston base.
The phrase is normally misquoted as “Houston, we
have a problem" as in the movie Apollo 13:
“Houston, we have a problem". See Houston, We've
Had a Problem (NASA).

That is life..
